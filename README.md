This app was built as part of a college project to predict salaries using machine learning models. I trained three different models — Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and Decision Tree — and selected the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics. The variables I used for prediction were chosen because they made the most logical sense in determining salary outcomes.
